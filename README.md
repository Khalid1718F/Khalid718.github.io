This is a simple responsive portfolio website that I have created using HTML CSS and JS. I tried my best to make it look aesthetically pleasing however it is still a work in progress.

I have used:

- HTML5 for markup
- Pure CSS3 for styling
- Bit of Jquery to make header animation effects work
- Bit of JavaScript to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices
- Font Awesome for Icons
- Unsplash for Images
